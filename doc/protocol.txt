Serial protocol, based on USB, but with more states to allow queueing commands
without waiting for ack.

Both ways:
DATAn: Multi-byte packet, includes 2-bit serial number.

NACKn: Packet was not not properly received; next expected packet is n.
ACKn: Packet n was properly received and handled.
STALLn: Packet n was properly received but there were errors in it.

STALLACK: Stall was received; communication is resumed.

Firmware to host:
DEBUG: Debug message follows without checksum protection.
STARTUP: Firmware started.
