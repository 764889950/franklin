Commands from host to firmware:

- goto f0,f1,x,y,z,e* (with optional callback) (fxyz is always abs, e always rel)
- home x+/y+/z (with optional callback)
- motor-sleep x+/y+/z+/e*
- run-extruder
- temperature b/e* (with optional callback)
- get all settings
- change all settings
- pause (unbuffered)

00: goto axes, f0?, f1?, x?, y?, z?, extruders?
01: goto axes, f0?, f1?, x?, y?, z?, extruders? with callback
02: home 01xyz, f0?, f1?
03: home 01xyz, f0?, f1? with callback
04: disable motor current
05: run extruder num, f
06: stop extruder num
07: set temperature axis, value
08: unset temperature axis
09: read-current-temperature axis
0a: save all settings
0b: reload all settings
0c: get-settings axis
0d: change-settings axis

fc: request response arg=version
fd: pause everything (no-op if already paused)
fe: continue (no-op if not paused)
ff: abort everything (possible after or without pause).


Responses from firmware to host:
read temperature response.
get all settings response.
startup (fc) response: ok or wrong-version.

Asynchronous events from firmware to host:
done goto
done home
