Firmware tasks:

- keep bed temperature constant
- keep extruder temperatures constant
- move x, y, z, e+ motors (goto and home)
- accept commands from serial or usb

Simplified temperature control:
Tf = Tthermistor - C * filament velocity.
C can be configured.


Temperature:

heater ----> thermistor and filament

When filament flows, heat is extracted.
Always, heat is radiated.

Extracted power = (soortelijke warmte filament * dichtheid filament) * flow of filament (mm^3/s) * temperature of filament (K) = C0 * (A * v) * Tf
Radiated power = sigma*T^4-sigma*T0^4 = C1 * (To^4-T0^4)
Added heat = P

If setup is calibrated, all except T0 are known.  Given equilibrium, T0 can be
computed from the heat that is added to the setup (which is equal to the total
lost heat).

P = C0 * A * v * Tf + C1 * (To^4 - T0^4)

Tf: target temperature.
P: calibrated value of full power times the fraction that is applied.
C0: calibrated constant.
C1: calibrated constant.
To: surface temperature; must be computed from calibration somehow.
T0: outside temperature; cannot be known.
A: surface of filament; passed in as diameter.
v: speed of filament; calibrated with steps/mm.

Assume slow response; have a ring buffer for prepared heat pulses.  Send more heat depending on expected outcome, not on current measurement.
