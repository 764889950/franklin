Installation instructions.

0. Install python-avahi.
1. If you're not running a webserver, install apache2
2. Make sure the "userdir" module is enabled:
	$ sudo a2enmod userdir
3. If it doesn't exist yet, create a directory named public_html in your home directory.
4. Put the directory containing this source into it.
5. Download https://raw.github.com/wijnen/python-network/master/network.py and put it into this directory.

The above only needs to be done once.  Now to actually run the server, do:

6. Run reprap-server.  If your printer is not on /dev/ttyACM0, provide its serial port using the --port argument.

Then to use it, open a browser and go to http://localhost/~username/most-reprap/.  Fill in your own username.

Enjoy. :-)
