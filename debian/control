Description: server for controlling RepRap 3-D printers
 3-D printers need firmware and host software to work.  This package contains
 both.  The following hardware is currently supported:
  * Controller board: all Arduino-based.  Melzi and Ramps have been tested.
  * Printer type: Carthesian and Delta
 If you need support for other controllers or printer types, let me know.
 .
 The server provides a web interface to a 3-D printer.  It also provides an
 interface for scripted control using python.
